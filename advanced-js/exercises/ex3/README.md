# Instructions

1. In this exercise, you will practice what you learned about creating an object that delegates its behavior to another object.

2. The code given to you in "ex3.js" is in the "old style" function/constructor/new style of defining objects and "inheritance". Modify the code to use the "OLOO" pattern with `Object.create()` instead of `new Constructor(..)` type code.
